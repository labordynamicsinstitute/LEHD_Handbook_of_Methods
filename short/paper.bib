  abstract = {Methods for statistical disclosure limitation have appeared in the
	published literature for over twenty years and in many cases have
	been incorporated into the practices of national statistical organizations.
	This paper presents the authors' views on establishing a research
	agenda that combines agency needs and potential advantages to respondents
	and data users. Separately for tabular data and microdata, the disclosure
	problem is discussed, methods and current practice are reviewed,
	and an agenda for research is presented. Issues regarding the effects
	of disclosure limitation on data quality and usefulness are examined.
	Disclosure limitation methods regarded as superior and suitable for
	general use are identified and the development and dissemination
	of corresponding statistical software is recommended. Skip this main

  abstract = {We initiate a theoretical study of the census problem. Informally,
	in a census individual respondents give private information to a
	trusted party (the census bureau), who publishes a sanitized version
	of the data. There are two fundamentally conflicting requirements:
	privacy for the respondents and utility of the sanitized data. Unlike
	in the study of secure function evaluation, in which privacy is preserved
	to the extent possible given a specific functionality goal, in the
	census problem privacy is paramount; intuitively, things that cannot
	be learned "safely" should not be learned at all. An important contribution
	of this work is a definition of privacy (and privacy compromise)
	for statistical databases, together with a method for describing
	and comparing the privacy offered by specific sanitization techniques.We
	obtain several privacy results using two different sanitization techniques,
	and then show how to combine them via cross training. We also obtain
	two utility results involving clustering.},

  abstract = {There are many distinctions between statistical research databases
	and those arising in commercial or administrative settings, and thus
	different issues regarding confidentiality and privacy protection
	on the one hand and and data access and the use of databases on the
	other. Data integration across multiple databases raises issues in
	both domains, especially with regard to protection against intruders.
	This paper highlights some methods developed to limit possible disclosure
	of confidential information from statistical databases while at the
	same time publicly releasing sufficient information to allow users,
	whether dataminers or other more traditional statistical analysts,
	sufficient data to reach proper statistical conclusions from their
	analyses. The disclosure limitation tools discussed include: data
	perturbation and simulation, partial releases, and sampling, with
	a special focus on partial release of data from multidimensional
	cross-classifications or contingency tables.},
