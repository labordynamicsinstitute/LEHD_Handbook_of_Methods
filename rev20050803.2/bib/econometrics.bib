  abstract = {Nonresponse is a pervasive problem in
	 survey research that can invalidate survey results and statistical
	 conclusions. Multiple imputation addresses the problem of nonresponse
	 using standard complete-data statistical tools. Multiple Imputation
	 for Nonresponse in Surveys explores a new, theoretically sound and
	 practically useful procedure that takes advantage of modern computing.
	 This procedure handles nonresponse in sample survey and censuses by
	 replacing each missing value with two or more imputations, analyzing the
	 resulting multiply-imputed data set using standard complete-data methods,
	 and then combining the complete-data answers in simple ways. After
	 introducing and defining general concepts in the first chapter, Dr.
	 Rubin presents background statistical material in the second chapter,
	 including basic ideas of both randomization and Bayesian inference in
	 surveys from finite populations with nonresponse. In Chapter 3 he
	 develops the Bayesian theory underlying the use of multiple imputation,
	 showing exactly how standard complete-data methods can be used to
	 analyze a multiply-imputed data set. Chapter 4 evaluates resultant
	 procedures in general circumstances from the randomization perspective,
	 and shows that in many cases only two or three imputations for each
	 missing value can lead to perfectly acceptable inferences. The final
	 two chapters outline specific procedures for creating imputation,
	 first in the ignorable case and then the nonignorable case. Data from
	 actual surveys are used in these two chapters to illustrate specific
	 techniques. Numerous examples are used throughout to reinforce ideas.
	 Each chapter is followed by many problems, ranging in difficulty
	 from simple exercises designed to check comprehension to possible
	 PhD thesis topics. Multiple Imputation for Nonresponse in Surveys
	 describes for statistical researches and advanced statistics students a
	 theoretically sound and practically useful perspective that is a
	 fertile topic for continuing statistical research. It provides applied
	 statisticians and substantive researchers involved with surveys for
	 statistical organizations and government agencies specific guidelines
	 for handling nonresponse in both public-use files and private-use
	 files. Finally, Multiple Imputation presents software developers
	 with general procedures for handling missing values in surveys that
	 would be an attractive component of statistical software packages.},

  journal = {jetrics},
  year = {1997},
  volume = {79},
  pages = {221-45},
  abstract = {OFFICIAL: In multivariate
	 hazard rate models, the duration variables are dependent if their
	 unobserved determinants are dependent on each other. This paper derives
	 properties of association measures for these duration variables. Sharp
	 bounds for correlations are derived in the general case as well as in
	 cases in which the bivariate distribution of unobservedheterogeneity
	 belongs to specific families. Similar results are derived for Kendall's
	 tau, which does not depend on the shape of the baseline hazard. The
	 results are useful for empirical analyses, as they can be used to
	 compare the flexibility of different heterogeneity distributions. },
