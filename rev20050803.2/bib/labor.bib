             role for the principal: administering incentive schemes that do
             not balance the budget. This new role is essential for
             controlling incentives and suggests that firms in which
             ownership and labor are partly separated will have an advantage
             over partnerships in which output is distributed among agents.
             A new characterization of informative (hence valuable)
             monitoring is derived and applied to analyze the value of
             relative performance evaluation. It is shown that competition
             among agents (due to relative evaluations) has merit solely as
             a device to extract information optimally. Competition per se
             is worthless. The role of aggregate measures in relative
             performance evaluation is also explored, and the implications

             theories of wage determination by examining differences in

             capital earnings functions are estimated using cross-sectional
             and longitudinal data from the CPS and QES. The major finding
             is that the dispersion in wages across industries as measured
             by the standard deviation in industry wage differentials is
             substantial. Furthermore, F tests of the joint significance of
             industry dummy variables are decisively rejected. These
             differences are very difficult to link to unobserved
             differences in ability or to compensating differentials for
             working conditions. Fixed effects models are estimated using
             two longitudinal data sets to control for constant, unmeasured
             worker characteristics that might bias cross-sectional
             estimates. Because measurement error is a serious problem in
             looking at workers who report changing industries, we use
             estimates of industry classification error rates to adjust the

             industry differentials are sizeable and are very robust under a

             similar using both data sets. These findings cast doubt on

             The members of the subminimum population are found to

             disagreement and by making the outcome depend not only on

             the late 1970's. While giving limited support to the

             seniority accumulates is the foundation of the theory of

             theories of compensation. The fact that persons with longer job
             tenures typically earn higher wages tends to support these
             views, yet this evidence ignores the decisions that have
