  abstract = {Methods for statistical
	 disclosure limitation have appeared in the published literature for
	 over twenty years and in many cases have been incorporated into the
	 practices of national statistical organizations. This paper presents
	 the authors' views on establishing a research agenda that combines
	 agency needs and potential advantages to respondents and data users.
	 Separately for tabular data and microdata, the disclosure problem is
	 discussed, methods and current practice are reviewed, and an agenda for
	 research is presented. Issues regarding the effects of disclosure
	 limitation on data quality and usefulness are examined. Disclosure
	 limitation methods regarded as superior and suitable for general use are
	 identified and the development and dissemination of corresponding
	 statistical software is recommended. Skip this main site navigation menu},

  number = {4},
  abstract = {The relatively recent
	 development of longitudinal establishment data sets has generated
	 considerable excitement in both the academic and the statistical
	 communities. The descriptive statistics coming out of these data
	 sets illustrate the large amount of volatility at the individual
	 establishment level that underlies the smooth time series of aggregate
	 employment growth. This finding not only has stimulated the review and
	 updating of existing labor market theories, but also has motivated U.S.
	 statistical agencies to produce longitudinal job flow statistics
	 from their administrative data sets. This article describes a new
	 longitudinal database from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that has the
	 potential for enhancing microdata research into topics such as job
	 creation, job destruction, and the life cycle of establishments.},
