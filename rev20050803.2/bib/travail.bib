  institution = {University of Iowa},
  year = {1996},
  abstract = {The essential idea of equilibrium search models of labour market
	 behaviour is that wage policy matters. In contrast, the stylized
	 neoclassical competitive model predicts that firms paying a wage above the
	 competitive equilibrium will disappear; those offering less will attract no
	 workers. The search approach introduces "friction" via information
	 asymmetries. Here, firms that offer high wages are more attractive to
	 workers, obtaining and retaining employees more readily than firms
	 offering lower wages. Other things equal high wage firms generate lower
	 profit per worker but make it up on volume. These simple ideas about
	 wage policy have been stated in informal ways by several scholars.
	 Hicks (1932, [1966]) discusses the 'Gospel of High Wages' whereby
	 unusually successful employers pay high wages to have the "pick of the
	 market" (p.36). Kerr (1954) initiated a long-surviving, although never
	 mainstream, line of research on empirical correlates of wage policy
	 that has since become known as "Dual Labour Market" theory. While
	 these early discussions of wage policy are often colorful, formal
	 content has been given to the ideas only recently in equilibrium search
	 models by Albrecht and Axell (1984), Burdett (1990), Burdett and
	 Mortensen (1995), and Mortensen (1990). In competitive models wage policy
	 doesn't matter because by definition in equilibrium the law of one
	 price holds: all workers of a given type receive the same wage. Even
	 in simple monopsony models of the labour market (Card and Krueger
	 (1995)) wage policy does not matter because the law of one price still
	 holds, albeit at lower than the competitive level. In contrast, search
	 models generate dynamic monopsony power for employers due to the
	 presence of frictions such as the length of time it takes to find a new
	 job. A firm's wage policy is important in such models because it
	 directly affects the distribution of income in an economy. Moreover
	 in such dynamic monopsony models public policy experiments such as
	 introducing or changing a minimum wage can have employment effects that are
	 quite different from those expected in the standard competitive case.},

	 Statistics's (BLS's) ES-202 data file. Both a longitudinal sample
	 and a repeated-cross-section sample drawn from these data indicate
	 similar or slightly faster employment growth in New Jersey relative to
	 eastern Pennsylvania after the rise in New Jersey's minimum wage,
	 consistent with the main findings of our earlier survey. We also use
	 the ES-202 data to measure the effects of the 1996 increase in the
	 federal minimum wage, which raised the minimum wage in Pennsylvania
	 but not in New Jersey. We find no indication of relative employment
	 losses in Pennsylvania. In light of these findings, we re-examine
	 employment trends in the sample of fast-food restaurants assembled by the
	 Employment Policies Institute (EPI) and David Neumark and William Wascher.
	 The differences between this sample and both the BLS data and our
	 earlier sample are attributable to a small set of restaurants owned
	 by a single franchisee who provided the original Pennsylvania data
	 for the 1995 EPI study. We also find that employment trends in the
	 EPI/Neumark-Wascher sample are strikingly different for firms that reported their
	 data on a weekly, biweekly or monthly basis, possibly because of
	 seasonal factors. Controlling for the systematic effects of the varying
	 reporting intervals, the combined EPI/Neumark-Wascher sample shows no
	 difference in hours growth between New Jersey and Pennsylvania. },

	 finds that even after controlling for a wide range of individual
	 characteristics and geographic location a substantial amount of individual wage
	 variation can be accounted for by industry differences. In the aggregate
	 industry effects explain at least 6.7 per cent of inter-personal wage
	 variation. At most they explain 30 per cent. While the importance of
	 industry differences is clear, the reasons for the differences are more
	 difficult to establish. Independent of the problems of interpreting the
	 correlates of industry differences, even the sign of the relation
	 of many variables with wages is difficult to establish when other
	 variables are included as controls. This conclusion is suggested by a
	 literature review and confirmed by an analysis of a large number
	 of alternative specifications of an industry wage equation using
	 individual wage data from the CPS and industry characteristics from a
	 number of recent sources. Only industry average education and industry
	 profitability have the same (positive) sign in every specification and in
	 all the studies reviewed. Of these two only average education was
	 nearly always significantly related to wages. Average establishment
	 size had a nearly consistent positive relation. What does emerge
	 from the analysis is a pattern of correlations. There appears to be
	 one major dimension (and perhaps other less important dimensions)
	 along which industries differ. A principal components analysis of an
	 industry characteristics data set is used to demonstrate this. High
	 wage industries have lower quit rates, higher labor productivity,
	 fewer women, more educated workers, longer work weeks, a higher ratio
	 of nonwage to wage compensation, higher unionization rates, larger
	 establishments and firms, higher concentration ratios and are more
	 profitable. An analysis of a limited number of industry characteristics in
	 1939 yields a similar pattern. The implications of these results for

	 institutions may affect the reallocation's magnitude and efficiency.
	 Most evidence to date on the connection between reallocation and
	 productivity dynamics for the U.S. and other countries comes from a single
	 industry: manufacturing. Building upon a unique establishment-level data
	 set of U.S. retail trade businesses, we provide some of the first
	 evidence on the connection between reallocation and productivity
	 dynamics in a non-manufacturing sector. Retail trade is a particularly
	 appropriate subject for such a study since this large industry lies at the
	 heart of many recent technological advances, such as E-commerce and
	 advanced inventory controls. Our results show that virtually all of the
	 productivity growth in the U.S. retail trade sector over the 1990s is
	 accounted for by more productive entering establishments displacing much
	 less productive exiting establishments. Interestingly, much of the
	 between-establishment reallocation is a within, rather than between-firm phenomenon. },

	 After synthesizing the evidence from recent studies, the authors

	 use of longitudinal micro data on service sector establishments is
	 one of the novel features of this analysis. The main findings are
	 summarized as follows: (i) the contribution of reallocation of outputs
	 and inputs from less productive to more productive establishments
	 plays a significant role in accounting for aggregate productivity
	 growth; (ii) for the selected service industries considered, the
	 contribution of net entry is dominant; (iii) the contribution of net
	 entry to aggregate productivity growth is disproportionate and is
	 increasing in the horizon over which the changes are measured since longer
	 horizon yields greater differentials from selection and learning

	 sizeable and are very robust under a variety of assumptions about

	 on unmeasured ability. Additional analysis finds that the industry
	 wage structure is highly correlated for workers in small and large

	 Finally, evidence is presented demostrating that turnover has a negative

	 There is no evidence that the business cycle is the driving force

	 prior labour market experience increases the likelihood of entering
	 self-employment as does having a spouse that is self- employed. Finally,

	 empirical implementation of the theoretical concepts. The empirical
	 section surveys the papers which have made use of direct and indirect
	 measures of human capital. In the latter case, where human capital is
	 measured by the number of years on the labor market and the number of
	 years with the current employer (representing firm-specific capital),
	 we focus our attention on a series of three papers which have all
	 tried to use panel data to deal with the question of individual and
	 job-match heterogeneity, i.e. Abraham and Farber (AER '87), Altonji

	 the explicit measures of human capital, we survey the burgeoning

	 return to seniority vanishes almost completely when we use either OLS,
	 GLS or IV-GLS estimation methods, although this conclusion varies
	 somewhat according to the occupation, some occupation classes showing
	 a negative net return to tenure and others showing a positive net
	 return. Note also that this result holds whether the analysis is
	 carried out at the 1-digit, 2-digit or 3-digit level. Therefore, it
	 seems that what matters most for the wage profile in terms of human

	 persistent, with earnings and wages remaining approx.9 percent below
	 their expected levels 6 or more years after displacement. I then show
	 that much of this persistence can be explained by additional job
	 losses in the years following an initial displacement. Workers who
	 avoid additional displacements have earnings and wage losses of 1
	 ercent and 4 percent 6 or more years after job loss. Comment: Uses
	 mean-difference wage regression, and includes dummies for (i) year(s) before
	 job loss [negative] (ii) year of job loss [negative] (iii) years
	 after (a) first job displacement [negative, sign. until about 9 years

	 Apprentices experienced fewer unemployment spells in the transition to
	 their first full-time employment than did non-apprentices. Among
	 apprentices, those trained in large firms had the smoothest transition to
	 employment; once employed, however, apprentices (whether they stayed
	 in their training firm or not) and non-apprentices had similar job
	 stability (as measured by tenure). An estimated 70 pct of apprenticeship

	 develops general, portable skills rather than firm-specific skills. The
	 author only looks at individuals that finished school during the

	 the labor force ('permanent attachment'). Stats are just means, no

	 Analysis distinguishes those graduates that stay with their first

	 wage effect of apprenticeships? There are remarkable differences
	 concerning the employment structure of first job workers, but the Probit

  abstract = {An increase in youth unemployment and a bi-modal wage distribution in the United
	 States have generated interest in the structure and performance of
	 alternative labour markets. In particular, comparatively satisfactory
	 outcomes in the German labour market are said to have been determined by
	 the interplay of the educational system and a number of training
	 programmes. This paper examines the performance of the German labour
	 market measured along two dimensions: earnings and mobility. Thereby,
	 it assesses the relative merits of different training choices as
	 distinguished by duration and specificity of the human capital acquired.
	 Having established the extent to which the various training programmes
	 affect labour mobility, the paper provides additional evidence on the
	 magnitude of wage differentials and the sources of earnings growth. },
