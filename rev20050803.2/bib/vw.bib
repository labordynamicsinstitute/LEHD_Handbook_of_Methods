  abstract =	 "From surveys at VW and Ruhrkohle AG, where
		  similar reductions in working hours were implemented. The
		  analysis is very simple: only raw sample means without
		  standard deviations are presented. The quality of the
		  data is thus often not verifiable. No data is furnished
		  whether a bias might exist in the questionnaire return
		  from different plants. The random pool for VW was 6.377,
		  the return therefrom was 2.767. Bias might thereby be a
		  significant problem. Similar problems aarise at RAG. It
		  is thus not clear if there are significant differences
		  f.i. across income groups. Furthermore, although the data
		  is multivariant, no regression analysis or any other type
		  of mulitvariate analysis was done. Apart from these data
		  handling problems, the surveys show that satisfaction is
		  quite high (round 50 pct) at VW, less so at RAG (35
		  pct). Still, a large percentage is ambivalent, and some
		  of the factors seem to be: ease of adaptation to the
		  financial constraints; (strongly) satisfaction with time
		  schedule models (a strong correlation exists between this
		  category and satisfaction with the whole program); sex
		  (women are more satisfied than men); not very
		  astoundingly at VW, given the Stufenplan: age (old and
		  young are more likely than middle aged to be
		  satisfied). Differences between the two companies occur
		  at different points. Thus, blue collar workers are more
		  satisfied than white-collar workers at VW, but the
		  contrary holds at RAG. Again, given the fact that working
		  time was not specified for white-collar workers at VW or
		  was already very flexible, this is not astonishing. At
		  VW, tension among colleagues is correlated with
		  dissatisfaction with the model. Correlations between the
		  existence of a perceived intensification of work effort
		  and satisfaction does not seem to be significant for
		  either firm. Differences in the elucidation of
		  preferences give strong hints as to the acceptance: Blue
		  collar workers in both companies would prefer more money,
		  whereas women would prefer more time. The reduction in
		  salary is done by nearly 80 pct in both companies through
		  a reduction in expenditures, 66 (42) reduce savings, and
		  about 42 pct do more home production. More men do the
		  latter than women, potentially due to the fact that women
		  already do more than twice as much home production as
		  men. Finally, Tab 24: at VW (RAG) 46 (60) pct would like
		  more money and longer working hours, whereas 53 (38)
		  would keep the current hours plan. Asked if they would
		  accept shorter working hours if combined with job
		  security, workers at RAG answered (Tab. 25) 51 pct only
		  if income were kept constant, wheras 21pct would accept a
		  partial income reduction. At VW, more women (73 pct) than
		  men (50 pct) prefer the shorter working hours. The same
		  goes for the young and the old, consistent with the fact
		  that they are more satisfied. "
