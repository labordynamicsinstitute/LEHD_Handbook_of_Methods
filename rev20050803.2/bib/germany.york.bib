  abstract =	 "From surveys at VW and Ruhrkohle AG, where
		  similar reductions in working hours were implemented. The
		  analysis is very simple: only raw sample means without
		  standard deviations are presented. The quality of the
		  data is thus often not verifiable. No data is furnished
		  whether a bias might exist in the questionnaire return
		  from different plants. The random pool for VW was 6.377,
		  the return therefrom was 2.767. Bias might thereby be a
		  significant problem. Similar problems aarise at RAG. It
		  is thus not clear if there are significant differences
		  f.i. across income groups. Furthermore, although the data
		  is multivariant, no regression analysis or any other type
		  of mulitvariate analysis was done. Apart from these data
		  handling problems, the surveys show that satisfaction is
		  quite high (round 50 pct) at VW, less so at RAG (35
		  pct). Still, a large percentage is ambivalent, and some
		  of the factors seem to be: ease of adaptation to the
		  financial constraints; (strongly) satisfaction with time
		  schedule models (a strong correlation exists between this
		  category and satisfaction with the whole program); sex
		  (women are more satisfied than men); not very
		  astoundingly at VW, given the Stufenplan: age (old and
		  young are more likely than middle aged to be
		  satisfied). Differences between the two companies occur
		  at different points. Thus, blue collar workers are more
		  satisfied than white-collar workers at VW, but the
		  contrary holds at RAG. Again, given the fact that working
		  time was not specified for white-collar workers at VW or
		  was already very flexible, this is not astonishing. At
		  VW, tension among colleagues is correlated with
		  dissatisfaction with the model. Correlations between the
		  existence of a perceived intensification of work effort
		  and satisfaction does not seem to be significant for
		  either firm. Differences in the elucidation of
		  preferences give strong hints as to the acceptance: Blue
		  collar workers in both companies would prefer more money,
		  whereas women would prefer more time. The reduction in
		  salary is done by nearly 80 pct in both companies through
		  a reduction in expenditures, 66 (42) reduce savings, and
		  about 42 pct do more home production. More men do the
		  latter than women, potentially due to the fact that women
		  already do more than twice as much home production as
		  men. Finally, Tab 24: at VW (RAG) 46 (60) pct would like
		  more money and longer working hours, whereas 53 (38)
		  would keep the current hours plan. Asked if they would
		  accept shorter working hours if combined with job
		  security, workers at RAG answered (Tab. 25) 51 pct only
		  if income were kept constant, wheras 21pct would accept a
		  partial income reduction. At VW, more women (73 pct) than
		  men (50 pct) prefer the shorter working hours. The same
		  goes for the young and the old, consistent with the fact
		  that they are more satisfied. "

		  apprenticeship graduates to that of graduates form
		  universities, full-time vocational schools, and secondary
		  schools. Apprentices experienced fewer unemployment
		  spells in the transition to their first full-time
		  employment than did non-apprentices. Among apprentices,
		  those trained in large firms had the smoothest transition
		  to employment; once employed, however, apprentices
		  (whether they stayed in their training firm or not) and
		  non-apprentices had similar job stability (as measured by
		  tenure). An estimated 70 pct of apprenticeship trainees
		  left their training firm within a five-year period. These
		  findings are consistent with the view that apprenticeship
		  training develops general, portable skills rather than
		  firm-specific skills. 
		  
		  The author only looks at individuals that finished school
		  during the sample. No correction whether or not the
		  individuals left the labor force after
		  apprenticeship/other forms of education actually stay in
		  the labor force ('permanent attachment'). Stats are just
		  means, no variances. Earnings of APP are 2068 cf. 1983
		  for unskilled workers with only secondary education (in
		  wage regression? different age!). Analysis distinguishes
		  those graduates that stay with their first employer, and
		  those that change.  
		  MAIN RESULT: apprentices transit quicker to their first
		  job. It seems trivial that if you are already in a work
		  relationship with an employer that your probability of
		  finding yourself unemployed are lower than for somebody
		  (student) who comes from OLF.  
		  MAIN RESULT: duration of first job does not differ
		  according to skill class. Unskilled workers get about the
		  same wage if they find a job, but are more likely to be
		  unemployed - what then is the wage effect of
		  apprenticeships? There are remarkable differences
		  concerning the employment structure of first job workers,
		  but the Probit he runs does not include sector/industry
		  variables.  
		  MAIN RESULT: apprentices from large firms have a
		  significantly higher probability of retention than
		  apprentices from small ones. Again, NO industry controls
		  (sample size very small? 526). This coordinates with view
		  in my paper on wages. 
		  MAIN RESULT: after  5 years, only 30 pct are retained,

		  undergirding the German system of apprenticeship
		  training. Many German firms face large net costs of
		  apprenticeship          training. Yet they continue to
		  provide such training in spite of considerable worker
		  turnover upon completion of the          training. The
		  simplest human capital model suggests that employers
		  would be willing to finance only firm-specific
		  training. Rather than engage in a futile debate over the
		  general or specific nature of the skills being provided,
		  we first          describe and evaluate 3 characteristics
		  of the German labor market which may lead firms to accept
		  part of the cost of          general training even in the
		  face of worker turnover. We then attempt to understand
		  why German workers and firms          may be more willing
		  to invest even in firm-specific skills than in the
		  U.S.. Finally, we discuss some implications of these
		  results for the current vocational training debate in the
		  U.S.."

unterentwickelte Ausbau des Dienstleistungsbereichs. Ein Vergleich mit den USA zeigt, dass dort 1993 mehr als zwei Drittel
des Volkseinkommens in Dienstleistungssektoren erzielt wurden, waehrend in Deutschland der entsprechende Anteil nur
knapp 40 vH betrug [1]. Aus dieser Differenz wird haeufig der Schluss gezogen, dass in Deutschland aufgrund von
Arbeitsmarkt- und sonstigen Rigiditaeten ein erhebliches Potential an Beschaeftigungsmoeglichkeiten im
Dienstleistungsbereich ungenutzt bleibt.

Dieser Befund ist allerdings Ergebnis einer Auswertung der Beschaeftigtendaten in sektoraler Gliederung. Nimmt man
hingegen eine Zuordnung nach den ausgeuebten Taetigkeiten, zeigt sich, dass der Anteil der Dienstleistungstaetigkeiten in
den USA und Deutschland mittlerweile etwa gleich hoch ist. Mithin besteht eine Dienstleistungsluecke in der vermuteten Art
nicht. Um so notwendiger ist eine gesamtwirtschaftlich orientierte Politik, die die Beschaeftigungsmoeglichkeiten sowohl im
industriellen als auch im Dienstleistungsbereich erhoeht. Dies gilt insbesondere fuer Ostdeutschland, wo ein industrieller
Kern erst im Entstehen begriffen ist."
