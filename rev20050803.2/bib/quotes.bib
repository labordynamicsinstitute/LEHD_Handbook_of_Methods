  abstract =	 "Training in Britain - as in many other places - is an
		  annoyingly wishy-washy affair. Can an American fox-hunter
		  clarify it? <p> PERHAPS no subject inspires more
		  hypocrisy in British business than training. Bosses
		  stress their ``commitment to people'' and the importance
		  of being ``a learning organisation''. In annual reports,
		  they boast of money lavished on wilderness courses for
		  welders and assertiveness coaching for
		  receptionists. Yet, according to new research by Leeds
		  University Business School, since 1985 there has been
		  little change in either the volume of off-the-job
		  training or the percentage of workers
		  participating. Another survey shows that spending on
		  training has actually fallen since 1993 (see ). <p> When
		  push comes to shove, British bosses - like many of their
		  peers in other countries - are dubious about the merits
		  of training. A survey of British business people by the
		  Institute of Personnel and Development found that almost
		  half preferred to poach trained workers rather than to
		  educate them; and more than a third worried that trained
		  people were more likely to leave the company. Meanwhile,
		  much of what the training industry does or says - the
		  high prices, the vapid prospectuses, the instructors who
		  get everyone's name wrong - confirms their
		  prejudices. Half of British companies fail to spend their
		  annual training budgets.  <p>  Laurie Bell has two things
		  going for her. The first is that she is about as vapid as
		  Margaret Thatcher. Convinced that the firms which came
		  recruiting at Syracuse Business School in New York state
		  in 1986 would not send her overseas quickly enough, she
		  marched to Europe and got her first job training
		  customers of the London International Financial Futures
		  Exchange. She has since set up and sold (very profitably)
		  a training company in Australia, and worked for Mast, one
		  of Britain's largest training firms. Quitting the latter
		  after something of a row, she took six months off to
		  learn how to hunt foxes. One suspects that she can run
		  them to ground with a glare. <p>   The second thing going
		  for Mrs Bell is that she thinks - sorry, she knows - that
		  she understands what is wrong with training in
		  Britain. Training comes in two sorts: job-specific (how
		  to use your computer system) and general (everything from
		  negotiating to managing time). Companies do most of the
		  first sort themselves. But since the purging of in-house
		  training departments in the 1980s, they have more often
		  contracted out the general-skills work. This sector,
		  which accounts for about half of Britain's £20 billion
		  ($32 billion) or so training bill, is where Mrs Bell sees
		  her chance. <p> The training industry is fragmented and
		  costly. It can cost £1,500 a day to hire a trainer to
		  coach employees at the workplace. But most firms are not
		  big enough to merit that investment. The rest send their
		  employees to ``open'' courses, which are designed for
		  individuals from different companies and typically held
		  in hotels; these can cost £500-700 a person. There are no
		  league tables or quality standards to speak of. <p> Mrs
		  Bell's answer is Syndicate Training ( ST ), a company
		  based in London but set up at her behest by the
		  Birmingham Chamber of Commerce. She chose the non-profit
		  chamber because she was in a hurry to prove that the
		  concept could work, and thought the chamber connection
		  would give her instant credibility. ST works by
		  persuading companies to form a buying pool for training
		  courses. A firm that joins ST pays £8,400 a year; this
		  entitles it to 24 courses, with no more than 12 to a
		  class. Most are two-day general-skills courses designed
		  for junior staff, with 40 titles ranging from absenteeism
		  to total quality management. For small firms, the
		  advantage is that ST provides open-course training at a
		  significant discount; large firms use it to fill the
		  occasional one-off need. <p>  Don't ask for whom the Bell
		  trains... <p>   So far virtually all of ST's 90 syndicate
		  slots have been filled by firms varying in size from
		  giants such as Gillette and Avon Cosmetics to small
		  20-person companies; several companies, including Leo
		  Burnett and Warner Brothers, have bought multiple
		  syndicates. Early reviews of the courses are good. A
		  second syndicate is in the works, as are plans to offer
		  customised in-house courses. It looks likely that others
		  - not Mrs Bell, who says that she has already made her
		  money - will now try to found for-profit companies that
		  will sell their services as syndicate-training
		  managers. ``In effect'', says Mrs Bell with typical brio,
		  ``we have re-engineered the buying process.'' <p> This is
		  an exaggeration. First, ST is an advance, rather than a
		  revolution. Businesses have been known to club together
		  to buy MBA courses and executive-education programmes. ST
		  's novelty is that it focuses on lower-level employees
		  and that it is organised by a third party, saving firms
		  the bother of co-ordination.  More fundamentally,
		  although ST offers a tidier way to buy training, it does
		  not really solve most bosses'  main concern about it,
		  which is more to do with its effectiveness - particularly
		  when it comes to ``soft'' skills like empowerment and
		  change management. True, plenty of companies, such as
		  Motorola and General Electric, have found that an
		  emphasis on training has helped the firm's
		  performance. But hard evidence on the efficacy of
		  non-job-specific training is hard to come by. A
		  forthcoming study of 300 medium-sized British firms by
		  Warwick Business School has found no correlation between
		  spending on training and profitability. As in
		  advertising, it seems that half of what is spent on
		  training works, but nobody knows which half. Until Mrs
		  Bell answers that question, British firms will keep a
		  tight grip on their training budgets. "
