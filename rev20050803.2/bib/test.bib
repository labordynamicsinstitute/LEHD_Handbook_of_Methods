		  employment trends using a comprehensive new data set
		  derived from the                 Bureau of Labor
		  Statistics's (BLS's) ES-202 data file. Both a
		  longitudinal                 sample and a
		  repeated-cross-section sample drawn from these data
		  indicate                 similar or slightly faster
		  employment growth in New Jersey relative to
		  eastern Pennsylvania after the rise in New Jersey's
		  minimum wage,                 consistent with the main
		  findings of our earlier survey. We also use the
		  ES-202 data to measure the effects of the 1996 increase
		  in the federal                 minimum wage, which raised
		  the minimum wage in Pennsylvania but not in
		  New Jersey. We find no indication of relative employment
		  losses in                 Pennsylvania. In light of these
		  findings, we re-examine employment trends
		  in the sample of fast-food restaurants assembled by the
		  Employment                 Policies Institute (EPI) and
		  David Neumark and William Wascher. The
		  differences between this sample and both the BLS data and
		  our earlier                 sample are attributable to a
		  small set of restaurants owned by a single
		  franchisee who provided the original Pennsylvania data
		  for the 1995 EPI                 study. We also find that
		  employment trends in the EPI/Neumark-Wascher
		  sample are strikingly different for firms that reported
		  their data on a weekly,                 biweekly or
		  monthly basis, possibly because of seasonal
		  factors. Controlling                 for the systematic
		  effects of the varying reporting intervals, the combined

		  growth                 between New Jersey and

		  differences for nonunion workers and finds that even
		  after controlling for     a wide range of individual
		  characteristics and geographic location a substantial
		  amount of individual wage variation can be     accounted
		  for by industry differences. In the aggregate industry
		  effects explain at least 6.7 per cent of inter-personal
		  wage     variation. At most they explain 30 per
		  cent. While the importance of industry differences is
		  clear, the reasons for the     differences are more
		  difficult to establish. Independent of the problems of
		  interpreting the correlates of industry differences,
		  even the sign of the relation of many variables with
		  wages is difficult to establish when other variables are
		  included as controls.     This conclusion is suggested by
		  a literature review and confirmed by an analysis of a
		  large number of alternative specifications     of an
		  industry wage equation using individual wage data from
		  the CPS and industry characteristics from a number of
		  recent     sources. Only industry average education and
		  industry profitability have the same (positive) sign in
		  every specification and in all     the studies
		  reviewed. Of these two only average education was nearly
		  always significantly related to wages. Average
		  establishment size had a nearly consistent positive
		  relation. What does emerge from the analysis is a pattern
		  of correlations.     There appears to be one major
		  dimension (and perhaps other less important dimensions)
		  along which industries differ. A     principal components
		  analysis of an industry characteristics data set is used
		  to demonstrate this. High wage industries have     lower
		  quit rates, higher labor productivity, fewer women, more
		  educated workers, longer work weeks, a higher ratio of
		  nonwage to wage compensation, higher unionization rates,
		  larger establishments and firms, higher concentration
		  ratios and are     more profitable. An analysis of a
		  limited number of industry characteristics in 1939 yields
		  a similar pattern. The implications of     these results
		  for alternative theories of wage determination are
		  considered. to be done"

		  the author analyzes the entrance of young individuals
		  into the German labor market, comparing the experience of
		  apprenticeship graduates to that of graduates form
		  universities, full-time vocational schools, and secondary
		  schools. Apprentices experienced fewer unemployment
		  spells in the transition to their first full-time
		  employment than did non-apprentices. Among apprentices,
		  those trained in large firms had the smoothest transition
		  to employment; once employed, however, apprentices
		  (whether they stayed in their training firm or not) and
		  non-apprentices had similar job stability (as measured by
		  tenure). An estimated 70 pct of apprenticeship trainees
		  left their training firm within a five-year period. These
		  findings are consistent with the view that apprenticeship
		  training develops general, portable skills rather than
		  firm-specific skills. 
		  
		  The author only looks at individuals that finished school
		  during the sample. No correction whether or not the
		  individuals left the labor force after
		  apprenticeship/other forms of education actually stay in
		  the labor force ('permanent attachment'). Stats are just
		  means, no variances. Earnings of APP are 2068 cf. 1983
		  for unskilled workers with only secondary education (in
		  wage regression? different age!). Analysis distinguishes
		  those graduates that stay with their first employer, and
		  those that change.  
		  MAIN RESULT: apprentices transit quicker to their first
		  job. It seems trivial that if you are already in a work
		  relationship with an employer that your probability of
		  finding yourself unemployed are lower than for somebody
		  (student) who comes from OLF.  
		  MAIN RESULT: duration of first job does not differ
		  according to skill class. Unskilled workers get about the
		  same wage if they find a job, but are more likely to be
		  unemployed - what then is the wage effect of
		  apprenticeships? There are remarkable differences
		  concerning the employment structure of first job workers,
		  but the Probit he runs does not include sector/industry
		  variables.  
		  MAIN RESULT: apprentices from large firms have a
		  significantly higher probability of retention than
		  apprentices from small ones. Again, NO industry controls
		  (sample size very small? 526). This coordinates with view
		  in my paper on wages. 
		  MAIN RESULT: after  5 years, only 30 pct are retained,

             theories of wage determination by examining differences in

             capital earnings functions are estimated using cross-sectional
             and longitudinal data from the CPS and QES. The major finding
             is that the dispersion in wages across industries as measured
             by the standard deviation in industry wage differentials is
             substantial. Furthermore, F tests of the joint significance of
             industry dummy variables are decisively rejected. These
             differences are very difficult to link to unobserved
             differences in ability or to compensating differentials for
             working conditions. Fixed effects models are estimated using
             two longitudinal data sets to control for constant, unmeasured
             worker characteristics that might bias cross-sectional
             estimates. Because measurement error is a serious problem in
             looking at workers who report changing industries, we use
             estimates of industry classification error rates to adjust the
             longitudinal results. In the fixed effects analysis, the
             industry differentials are sizeable and are very robust under a
             variety of assumptions about classification errors and are
             similar using both data sets. These findings cast doubt on
             explanations of industry wage differentials based on unmeasured
             ability. Additional analysis finds that the industry wage
             structure is highly correlated for workers in small and large
             firms, in different regions of the U.S., and with varying job
             tenures. Finally, evidence is presented demostrating that
             turnover has a negative relationship with industry wage
             differentials. These findings suggest that workers in high wage

The data support the conjecture that the greater the predicted probability that a given worker will leave early, the lower that worker's chances of receiving notice. Employers do appear to be concerned about "destructive attrition." Incorporating concern about attrition into the specification used to predict advance notice reduces the effects of selection bias in predicting attrition. The data used in the analysis make no distinction between written and oral notice, nor between notice received a few days before the closing and notice provided months in advance. It is even possible that, without such information, the probability of early departure acts in part as a proxy for different sorts of notice. }

Firms' incentives to inform employees about their future viability are analyzed using a 2-period signaling model. It is shown that, if wages can be set after firms learn their viability, they will perfectly signal firms' closure plans. Mandatory notice laws, if they have any effect at all, reduce worker utility and raise profits because they obviate the need for "permanent" firms to signal via higher wages. If a noncontingent wage must be set before any private information arrives, pooling occurs in the absence of legislation, and mandatory-notice laws can be Pareto improving. }

Penalties for failure to provide the required advance notice include back pay and benefits for each displaced worker for each day of violation and a fine of \$500 per day for failing to notify local government. Advance notice requirements ease displaced workers' shock and facilitates their search for alternative employment or additional training. It appears that formal written notice increases the likelihood that an individual will avoid unemployment. Although WARN has only been in effect since 1988, compliance with WARN appears to be high. It does not affect manufacturing firms primarily, and it does not affect a substantial proportion of permanently laid-off workers. }

Further, preunemployment search determinants differ for notified (nonnotified) workers and men (women). For notified men, search is strongly increased by longer notice and strongly decreased by higher unemployment insurance benefits. But neither factor affects the employed search decisions of notified women.}

As part of the plan, AT&T and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) formed a partnership called "the alliance" that operated in concert with the state of North Carolina. In addition, the US Department of Labor gave the state a \$1.3-million grant to administer dislocated worker services at AT&T. However, some problems did arise. The plant closed earlier than AT&T's announced date, and employees did not feel that the closure was justified.

A "sequential-regimes" job search model is developed that allows searches prior to displacement for workers with advance knowledge of layoff, with different search intensities before and after layoff. Maximum-likelihood estimates of the model are computed using a pooled data set from the 1984 and 1986 Displaced Worker Surveys. Advance knowledge is found to significantly shorten jobless duration and may even benefit most labor force groups. }

psychological perspective, the relationship between the survivor and the laid-off employee plays an important role in the survivor's perceptions, attitudes, and behavior. Besides procedural and distributive
justice, effective communications between employees and managers are vital. Managers need to display their interpersonal skills, talk to laid-off employees politely, offer outplacement services, and allow them to

establishments. We find that firms that re-engineer their workplaces to
incorporate more high performance practices experience higher
productivity. Profit sharing and/or stock options are also associated with
increased productivity. In addition, we find that employee voice has a
larger positive effect on productivity when it is done in the context of
unionized establishments. When we examine the determinants of wages within
these establishments, we find that re-engineering a workplace to
incorporate more high performance practices leads to higher wages. However,
increasing the usage of profit sharing or stock options results in lower
regular pay for workers especially technical workers and clerical/sales
workers. Finally, increasing the percentage of workers meeting regularly in
groups has a larger positive effect on wages in unionized establishments.
