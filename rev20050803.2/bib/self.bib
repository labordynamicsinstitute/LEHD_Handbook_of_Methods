  abstract = {This article studies mobility patterns of German workers in light of a model of
	 sector-specific human capital. Furthermore, I employ and describe
	 little-used data on continuous on-the-job training occuring after
	 apprenticeships. Results are presented describing the incidence and duration of
	 continuous training. Continuous training is quite common, depite
	 the high incidence of apprenticeships which precedes this part of
	 a worker's career. Most previous studies have only distinguished
	 between firm-specific and general human capital, generally concluding
	 that training was general. Inconsistent with those conclusions, I
	 show that German men are more likely to find a job within the same
	 sector if they have received continuous training in that sector.
	 These results are similar to results obtained for young U.S. workers,
	 and suggest that sector-specific capital is an important feature
	 of very different labor markets. Furthermore, the results suggest
	 that the observed effect of training on mobility is sensitive to the
	 state of the business cycle, indicating a more complex interaction
	 between supply and demand that most theoretical models allow for. },

  number = {97s-42},
  abstract = {Using data from the National
	 Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), we re-examine the effect of
	 formal on-the-job training on mobility patterns of young American
	 workers. By employing parametric duration models, we evaluate the
	 economic impact of training on productive time with an employer.
	 Confirming previous studies, we find a positive and statistically
	 significant impact of formal on-the-job training on tenure with the
	 employer providing the training. However, expected duration net of the
	 time spent in the training program is generally not significantly
	 increased. We proceed to document and analyze intra-sectoral and
	 cross-sectoral mobility patterns in order to infer whether training provides
	 firm-specific, industry-specific, or general human capital. The econometric
	 analysis rejects a sequential model of job separation in favor of
	 a competing risks specification. We find significant evidence for
	 the industry-specificity of training. The probability of sectoral
	 mobility upon job separation decreases with training received in
	 the current industry, whether with the last employer or previous
	 employers, and employment attachment increases with on-the-job training.
	 These results are robust to a number of variations on the base model.},

  title = {Wage Flexibility and Contract Structure in Germany },

  year = {1996},
  type = {Scientific Series},
  number = {96s-28},
  abstract = {In this paper, we look at how labor market conditions at different
	 points during the tenure of individuals with firms are correlated with
	 current earnings. Using data from the German Socioeconomic Panel
	 on individuals for the period 1984 to 1994, we find that both the
	 contemporaneous unemployment rate and prior values of the unemployment
	 rate are significantly correlated with current earnings, contrary to
	 results for the American labor market. We interpret this result as
	 evidence that German unions do in fact bargain over both wages and
	 employment, but that the models of individualistic contracts, such as
	 the implicit contract model, may explain some of the observed wage
	 drift and longer-term wage movements reasonably well. Furthermore, we
	 explore the heterogeneity of contracts over a variety of worker and job
	 characteristics. In particular, we find evidence that contracts differ
	 across industries and across firm size. Workers of large firms are
	 remarkably more insulated from the job market than workers for any other
	 type of firm, indicating the importance of internal job markets. },
