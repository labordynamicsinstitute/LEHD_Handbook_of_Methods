  abstract =	 "This paper illustrates an incentive for workers to
		  conform to the opinion of their supervisors when firms
		  use subjective performance evaluation. This desire to
		  conform arises endogenously from the firm's need to
		  induce the worker to exert effort. The author shows that
		  firms may optimally eschew the use of incentive contracts
		  to retain workers' incentives for honesty. The author
		  illustrates that the incentive to conform implies
		  inefficiencies, even when workers are risk-neutral, and
		  is likely to lead to more centralized decision-making
    		  than in the absence of the desire to conform. .  "
