  abstract =     "This article reconciles the psychological notion of
		  bonuses and  penalties as incentive devices with an
		  economic view  of incentives. An objective
		  definition of bonus  and penalty schemes is
		  presented and shown  to correspond to equilibrium in
		  a model of  moral hazard and probabilistic
		  monitoring. The model  implies that
		  middle-management and other  nonproduction jobs are
		  appropriate  for bonus-type incentive contracts,
		  whereas in either  unskilled jobs or aspects of
		  highly skilled  jobs that require diligence but no
		  skill, penalty  incentive schemes are predicted. We
		  argue that  our model illuminates an internal
		  contradiction in  the prospect theory of Kahneman
		  and Tversky. We also argue that Japanese
		  manufacturing systems have inherent incentive
		  properties  that elicit a high level of diligence
		  from factory workers. "

			- log(w) show 1/7 signifcant FAILRATE and 2/7

		  play in the  determination of work hours. Following
		  previous research by Lang  (1989), we use a
		  conventional efficiency wage model to analyze  how
		  firms respond to worker preferences regarding
		  wage-hours  packages. We find that when workers are
		  homogeneous, the role of  worker preferences in
		  determining work hours is similar to the  simple
		  neoclassical model of labor supply.  For instance,
		  if  worker preferences shift in favor of shorter
		  hours, firms will  respond by offering jobs
		  entailing shorter hours. When workers  have
		  heterogeneous preferences, however, employers will
		  want to  use a worker's hours preference as a signal
		  for the  responsiveness of the worker to the work
		  incentives used by the  firm, and workers in turn
		  may not reveal their hours  preferences. Our key
		  finding in this instance is that the labor  market
		  equilibrium may be characterized by a sub-optimal
		  number  of short-hour jobs. This shortage of
		  short-hour jobs is likely  to be found in high wage
		  labor markets.  "
