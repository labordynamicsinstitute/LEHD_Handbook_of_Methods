  abstract =	 {Using data that permit a distinction between flows of workers (directly measured) and job
  creation and destruction (again, directly measured), the authors develop employment and job flow statistics
  for a representative sample of French establishments from 1987 to 1990. Annual job creation can be
  characterized as hiring three persons and separating two for each job created in a given year. Annual job
  destruction can be characterized as hiring one person and separating two for each job destroyed in a given
  year. When an establishment is changing employment, the adjustment is made primarily by reducing entry and
  not by changing the separation rates. There is considerable simultaneous hiring and separation, even
  controlling for skill group. Two-thirds of all hiring is on short-term contracts, and more than half of all
  separations are due to the end of these short-term contracts.}
